	<h2> Common Limitations </h2>

	<p> SimplePass was designed to stand out from the rest of the pack. The best way to illustrate this, is to show the common limitations with other password managers.</p>


	<div class="row clearfix">

		<div class="column third">
			<h3> Copy/Paste </h3>
			<p> The copy/paste framework is insecure because any installed application can examine the clipboard </p>
			
		</div>

		<div class="column third">
			<h3> In-App Web Browser </h3>
			<p> Prevents users from inputing passwords in other applications and from using their preferred web browser</p>
		</div>

		<div class="column third">
			<h3> Unintuitive </h3>
			<p> Users are required to learn difficult concepts and user interfaces are not optimized</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h2> The Simple Approach </h2>

	<p> SimplePass aims to address these shortcomings with a new password input system. </p>

	<div class="row clearfix">

		<div class="column third">
			<h3> Simple </h3>
			<p> Users can think of their password in terms of Vaults and Accounts. Passwords are stored in Accounts. Accounts are stored in vaults. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="column third">
			<h3> Ubiquitous </h3>
			<p> The new input system a touch away no matter where you are in your device  </p>
		</div>

		<div class="column third">
			<h3> Unobtrusive  </h3>
			<p> The input system is brought up by touching each side of the device's screen. This unique gesture prevents unintentional touches.   </p>
		</div>
