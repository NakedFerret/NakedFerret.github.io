					<h1> Who am I? </h1>
				</div>

				<p> Here's a little tid-bit about me. If you're looking for a more professional representation, check out my portfolio. My resume and projects are there. </p>

				<p>I'm a person that cannot sit idly by unless I am learning or consuming something that has been made with a lot of love. I don't like repetition, so I don't fall into routines and I try to make tools that save me time. Of course, I end up wasting more time creating the tools than finishin the repetetive task but at least I enjoy the experience. 
					</p>

				<p> I have focused on learning about mobile and security. </p>

				<p> Mobile is kind of like my first technological love. The first time I created something on my own and outside of school was with my Android phone. My friends and I used to play a dice game on our phones. It had some bugs that seemed like they were never going to get fixed. I thought to myself, I could do better than that! Two weeks later we were playing my version of the game. </p>

				<p> I learned about security because of the direction our society is going. Our definition of privacy has shifted as a society and I think it's because people don't expect anything to be secret anymore. I want to change that perception and I believe studying and appliying cryptography is the key to accomplishing this. </p>

				<p> I generally loathe exercise ( see 'repetition' above ), but I'm love playing sports. I'm up for anything but I enjoy soccer the most. I practice Capoeira and am learning how to play the piano when I have free time. </p>
